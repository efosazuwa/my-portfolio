#  Efosa's Portfolio
A sampling of data science projects that I have completed or in progress.

# [Project 1: Authorship Identification With Markov Chains(Unfinished)](https://github.com/efosazuwa/markov_project)
For this project I built an authorship identification model with markov chains as the engine. I presented this as my senior project in probability and the presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hekx661TCKPk-plh0Qi3wfAaYu22OFJeHjzL5LfukWA/edit?usp=sharing). The concept of authorship analysis isn't new but chaining the base results of a markov chain with other machine learning results may net some interesting results
* I was able to demonstrate a lower probabiity score between a true shakespeare work and a forgery
* TODO Extract more features to put into a logistic regression
* TODO Build a client facing API using flask

# [Project 2: Covid-19 Worldwide Daily Cases Tracker](https://covid-19-plotly-dash-app.herokuapp.com)
This project is a dashboard visualization of covid cases around the world.

# [Project 3: Electric Vehicle Charging Detection(Unfinished)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1imM6GxT0zFiLUi0VVbpDA_JsNNKIwn16#scrollTo=O6a21YEWCzbF)
* Build visualizations that identify annomalies with seaborn and plotly
* Engineered features from primary dataset 
* Investigate annomaly detection with naive gaussian methods, Isolation forests, and Local Outlier Factor. 
* TODO build different forecasting models with ARMA FFT, and RNN
* TODO Build a client facing API using flask

# [Project 4: House Sale Price Prediction and Deployment(Unfinished)](https://github.com/efosazuwa/housing_prices_deployment)
* Data Analysis and Data Visualization
* Engineered features from primary dataset 
* Predicted Sales Price with a logistic regression. 
* TODO build different models and ensemble them
* TODO Build a client facing API using flask

# Project 5: Assortment of optimization models
* This will serve as a growing list of optimization models I've created to keep my Linear Programming skills sharp
  * [Battery Arbitrage](https://github.com/efosazuwa/Battery-Arbitrage)
